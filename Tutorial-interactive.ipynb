    "One of the features of *CYCLUS* is its ability to switch between different models of the facilities within the fuel cycle.  These models, called **archetypes**, may change how the facility interacts with other facilities or how the physics of the facility are represented.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For example, reactor archetypes may change how the reactor experiences fuel burnup and its fresh and spent fuel compostions.  A very simple model might take fixed input and output recipes, and assume all material entering matches its input, and all material exiting matches its output.  A more complex model may tabulate reactor performance and physics parameters, and use interpolation to determine input and output recipes.  The most complex model could perform a full depletion calculation each time new fuel enters the reactor.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A simple set of archetypes have been created in [Cycamore](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html).  They are a good fit for simple tutorials, or for modeling facilities that are required, but not the focus of the simulation.  The Cycamore archetypes include:\n",
    "-  [Source](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=source#cycamore-source): This is a generic source of fresh material.  This could be an uranium mine, an enrichment facility, or even a fabrication facility, depending on how explicitly the user wants to model the front-end of the fuel cycle.\n",
    "-  [Enrichment](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=enrichment#cycamore-enrichment): This archetype uses the standard equations for enrichment of U-235, and has a limit on total enrichment capacity.\n",
    "-  [Reactor](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=reactor#cycamore-reactor): This facility takes set input and output fuel recipes, and loads new assemblies at regular intervals.\n",
    "-  [Separations](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=separations#cycamore-separations): This facility splits all the isotopes in its input stream into separate output streams.\n",
    "-  [FuelFab](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=fuelfab#cycamore-fuelfab): This archetype uses the d-factor approach to mix streams of fissile and fissionable material and approximate a given recipe.\n",
    "-  [Sink](http://fuelcycle.org/user/cycamoreagents.html?highlight=sink#cycamore-sink):  This is a generic sink for any facility that will permanently hold nuclear material.  This could be an interim storage facility, a geological repository, or other long-term disposal methods a user may want to model.\n",
